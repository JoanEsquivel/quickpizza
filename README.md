## What is QuickPizza? üçïüçïüçï

`QuickPizza` is a web application, used for demonstrations and workshops, that generates new and exciting pizza combinations! 

The app is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for the frontend and [Go](https://go.dev/) for the backend.

The tests written for `QuickPizza` demonstrates the basic and advanced functionalities of k6, ranging from a basic load test to using different modules and extensions.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Grafana k6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/) (v.0.43.1 or higher)

If you are running the xk6-disruptor test, Kubernetes needs to be setup and `minikube` to be downloaded. 

- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

## Run locally with Docker

To run the app locally with Docker, run the command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 3333:3333  ghcr.io/grafana/quickpizza-local:latest
```

That's it!

Now you can go to [localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) and get some pizza recommendations!

## Using k6 to test it

All tests live in the `k6` folder. Within this folder, you will find the following folders:

- [foundations](k6/foundations/) - covers the basic functionalities of k6.
- [browser](k6/browser/) - covers a more deep-dive look on how to use the k6 browser module for browser and web performance testing.
- [disruptor](k6/disruptor/) - covers a more deep-dive look on how to use xk6-disruptor for failure injection testing.
- [advanced](k6/advanced) - covers tests that are more advanced such as hybrid tests, tracing, etc.

To run tests on the `foundations` folder, you can use the following commands:

```bash
cd k6/foundations
k6 run 01.basic.js
```

If you want to run one iteration with one virtual user, you can use the following command:

```bash
k6 run --iterations 1 --vus 1 01.basic.js
```

If QuickPizza is available remotely, then pass the hostname and port through the `BASE_URL` environment variable as follows:

```bash
k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://acmecorp.dev 01.basic.js
# or 
k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://acmecorp.dev:3333 01.basic.js
```

If the test uses the [browser module](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-browser/), you need to pass the `K6_BROWSER_ENABLED=true` environment variable:

```bash
K6_BROWSER_ENABLED=true k6 run --iterations 1 --vus 1 browser.js
```

If the test uses an extension, you need to build it first via xk6. To build the extension using Docker, you can run the following command:

```bash
cd k6/foundations/extension

docker run --rm -e GOOS=darwin -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "${PWD}:/xk6" \
  grafana/xk6 build  \
  --with xk6-internal=.
```

Note that the `GOOS` variable is for Mac. Please refer to [Build a k6 binary using Docker](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/guides/build-a-k6-binary-using-docker/) for more information.

To run the test that uses an extension, you can run the following command:

```bash
K6_BROWSER_ENABLED=true ./extension/k6 run 11.extension.js
```

## Running a Prometheus instance

If you want to stream the metrics to a Prometheus instance, you need, well, a Prometheus instance. You can use the following command to run a local one:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
             --storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus \
             --web.console.libraries=/usr/share/prometheus/console_libraries \
             --web.console.templates=/usr/share/prometheus/consoles \
             --web.enable-remote-write-receiver
```

## Deploy application to Kubernetes

If you want to run a test that uses xk6-disruptor, you need to deploy QuickPizza to Kubernetes.

If you are already running the app with Docker, make sure you stop the `QuickPizza` container first.

Then, start minikube by running the command:

```bash
minikube start
```

To deploy the application, run: 

```bash
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/
```

The `kubernetes/kustomization.yaml` file contains some commented lines that, if enabled, will configure tracing for the quickpizza app. Feel free to uncomment those lines and input your OTLP credentials if you want this functionality.

When deployed in Kubernetes, the QuickPizza application will deploy a number of different pods, each one being a microservice for the application:

```
kubectl get pods

NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
quickpizza-catalog-749d46c785-4q6s5   1/1     Running   0          7s
quickpizza-copy-7f879947c5-rslhg      1/1     Running   0          7s
quickpizza-frontend-bf447c76-9nb8f    1/1     Running   0          7s
quickpizza-recs-644d498964-6l48p      1/1     Running   0          7s
quickpizza-ws-7d444d9cd6-mkkmd        1/1     Running   0          7s
```

You should also see a bunch of services associated with these pods:

```
kubectl get services

NAME                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes            ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          1s
quickpizza-catalog    ClusterIP      10.104.201.242   <none>        3333/TCP         6s
quickpizza-copy       ClusterIP      10.97.255.59     <none>        3333/TCP         6s
quickpizza-frontend   LoadBalancer   10.99.177.165    <pending>     3333:30333/TCP   6s
quickpizza-recs       ClusterIP      10.103.37.197    <none>        3333/TCP         6s
quickpizza-ws         ClusterIP      10.106.51.76     <none>        3333/TCP         6s
```

A service of particular interest is `quickpizza-frontend`, of type `LoadBalancer`. This is the service we need to access in our browser to reach the application. You should see that the external IP for this service is currently `<pending>`. In order to make it reachable from outside the cluster, we need to [assign the external IP of the cluster](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/get-started/expose-your-application/). Using `minikube`, open another terminal window and run:

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

The external IP should be assigned:

```bash
kubectl get services

NAME                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
# ...
quickpizza-frontend   LoadBalancer   10.99.177.165    10.99.177.165   3333:30333/TCP   3m9s
#                                                     ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Note this ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
```

You should now be able to access the application on port `3333` in the IP address noted below in your browser, which in our example was `10.99.177.165`.

### Running xk6-disruptor tests

To build the [xk6-disruptor](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-disruptor) extension for fault injection testing, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd k6/disruptor

docker run --rm -e GOOS=darwin -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "${PWD}:/xk6" \
  grafana/xk6 build  \
  --with github.com/grafana/xk6-disruptor
```

To run a basic xk6-disruptor test, run the following command on the `k6/disruptor` folder:

```bash
./k6 run 01.basic.js
```

To run an example hybrid test of browser and xk6-disruptor, run the following command:

```bash
K6_BROWSER_ENABLED=true ./k6 run ../advanced/01.browser-with-disruptor.js
```

## Deploy to Fly.io

[Authenticate using the fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/). Then, run the CLI to deploy the application and set up the internal port `3333` that the server listens to.

```bash
fly launch --internal-port 3333 --now
```
