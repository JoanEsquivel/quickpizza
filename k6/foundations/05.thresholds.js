 * K6 FOUNDATIONS: PERFORMANCE THRESHOLDS AND QUALITY GATES
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * üéØ LEARNING GOAL: Master k6 thresholds as automated quality gates that define
 *    acceptable performance criteria and automatically fail tests when violated.
 * 
 * üìã WHAT THIS SCRIPT TEACHES:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Setting up performance thresholds as quality gates
 *    ‚Ä¢ Using built-in metrics (http_req_failed, http_req_duration) for SLA enforcement
 *    ‚Ä¢ Creating custom metrics (Counter, Trend) with specific thresholds
 *    ‚Ä¢ Understanding pass/fail criteria for automated performance testing
 *    ‚Ä¢ Configuring threshold behaviors (abortOnFail vs continue)
 * 
 * üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è HOW TO RUN THIS TEST:
 *    cd k6/foundations
 *    k6 run 05.thresholds.js
 * 
 *    # With QuickPizza running elsewhere:
 *    k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://quickpizza.grafana.com 05.thresholds.js
 * 
 *    # With dashboard for real-time monitoring:
 *    K6_WEB_DASHBOARD=true k6 run --linger 05.thresholds.js
 * 
 * ‚è±Ô∏è EXPECTED TEST EXECUTION:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Duration: 20 seconds total (5s ramp-up + 10s sustained + 5s ramp-down)
 *    ‚Ä¢ Virtual Users: 5 concurrent users maximum
 *    ‚Ä¢ Load Pattern: Gradual ramp-up to steady state, then graceful shutdown
 *    ‚Ä¢ Total Requests: ~50 HTTP requests (5 VUs √ó 10 seconds √∑ 1s sleep)
 *    ‚Ä¢ Request Rate: ~5 requests/second during sustained phase
 * 
 * üìä KEY METRICS TO MONITOR:
 * 
 *    BUILT-IN METRICS (with thresholds):
 *    ‚Ä¢ http_req_failed: < 1% (Quality Gate: 99% success rate required)
 *    ‚Ä¢ http_req_duration p95: < 500ms (Quality Gate: 95% of users get sub-500ms response)
 *    ‚Ä¢ http_req_duration p99: < 1000ms (Quality Gate: 99% of users get sub-1s response)
 * 
 *    CUSTOM METRICS (with thresholds):
 *    ‚Ä¢ quickpizza_number_of_pizzas: Counter tracking total pizzas created
 *    ‚Ä¢ quickpizza_ingredients: Average < 8 ingredients per pizza (Quality Gate)
 * 
 * üéõÔ∏è DASHBOARD ANALYSIS GUIDE:
 * 
 *    OVERVIEW TAB - Watch for Quality Gate Violations:
 *    ‚úÖ Green: HTTP Request Failed Rate stays below 1%
 *    ‚úÖ Green: P95 Response Time stays below 500ms
 *    ‚úÖ Green: P99 Response Time stays below 1000ms
 *    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Any metric approaching threshold limits
 *    ‚ùå Critical: Threshold violations (test will show FAILED status)
 * 
 *    TIMINGS TAB - Detailed Performance Breakdown:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Request Duration: Should consistently stay under p95/p99 thresholds
 *    ‚Ä¢ Request Waiting (TTFB): Server processing time for pizza generation
 *    ‚Ä¢ Request Failed Rate: Must stay below 1% threshold
 * 
 *    SUMMARY TAB - Final Quality Gate Results:
 *    ‚Ä¢ http_req_duration: Check p95 < 500ms, p99 < 1000ms
 *    ‚Ä¢ http_req_failed: Must show < 1% failure rate
 *    ‚Ä¢ Custom metrics: quickpizza_ingredients average < 8
 *    ‚Ä¢ Overall test result: PASS/FAIL based on all thresholds
 * 
 * üö® PERFORMANCE THRESHOLDS EXPLAINED:
 * 
 *    RELIABILITY THRESHOLD:
 *    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'] = Less than 1% of requests can fail
 *    ‚Üí This ensures 99% success rate for system reliability
 * 
 *    USER EXPERIENCE THRESHOLDS:
 *    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500', 'p(99)<1000']
 *    ‚Üí p95 < 500ms: 95% of users get responses in under 500ms (good UX)
 *    ‚Üí p99 < 1000ms: 99% of users get responses in under 1s (acceptable worst-case)
 * 
 *    BUSINESS LOGIC THRESHOLD:
 *    quickpizza_ingredients: [{ threshold: 'avg<8', abortOnFail: false }]
 *    ‚Üí Average pizza complexity should be reasonable (< 8 ingredients)
 *    ‚Üí abortOnFail: false = Continue test even if this threshold fails
 * 
 * üîç WHAT TO WATCH DURING EXECUTION:
 *    1. Threshold status in real-time (dashboard shows green/red indicators)
 *    2. Console output showing pizza names and ingredient counts
 *    3. Response times staying within acceptable ranges
 *    4. Zero or minimal error rates
 *    5. Final test result: PASSED or FAILED based on threshold compliance
 * 
 * üéØ PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Thresholds act as automated quality gates for CI/CD pipelines
 *    ‚Ä¢ Failed thresholds = failed test = blocked deployment
 *    ‚Ä¢ Helps maintain performance standards across releases
 *    ‚Ä¢ Provides objective pass/fail criteria for performance testing
 * 
 * üí° PRO TIPS:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Set realistic thresholds based on actual user expectations
 *    ‚Ä¢ Use abortOnFail: true for critical thresholds to stop tests early
 *    ‚Ä¢ Monitor threshold trends over time to catch performance degradation
 *    ‚Ä¢ Combine multiple threshold types for comprehensive quality gates
