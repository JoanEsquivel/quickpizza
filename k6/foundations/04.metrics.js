/**
 * K6 CUSTOM METRICS: QuickPizza API Business Intelligence Testing
 * 
 * GOAL: Demonstrate how to create and use custom K6 metrics for business-specific monitoring
 * 
 * This script shows how to:
 * - Create custom Counter metrics (cumulative values)
 * - Create custom Trend metrics (statistical distributions)
 * - Track business-specific KPIs alongside technical performance
 * - Use setup() and teardown() lifecycle functions
 * - Combine custom metrics with standard HTTP performance metrics
 * 
 * USAGE: k6 run k6/foundations/04.metrics.js
 * 
 * EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
 * - Test Duration: 20 seconds total (5s ramp-up + 10s steady + 5s ramp-down)
 * - Peak Load: 5 concurrent virtual users
 * - Request Rate: ~5 requests/second during steady state
 * - Total Requests: ~75-100 requests (depending on response times)
 * - Custom Metrics: Pizza count tracking and ingredient distribution analysis
 * 
 * FOCUS: Custom metrics and K6 lifecycle functions (setup/teardown)
 * 
 * For standard K6 metrics analysis, see 02.stages.js and charts-understanding.md
 * 
 * CUSTOM BUSINESS METRICS:
 * üìà quickpizza_number_of_pizzas (Counter):
 *   - Tracks total pizzas successfully created
 *   - Business KPI: Pizza creation rate and total volume
 *   - Should increment by 1 for each successful pizza order
 * 
 * üìà quickpizza_ingredients (Trend):
 *   - Tracks ingredient count distribution across pizzas
 *   - Business insight: Complexity of generated pizzas
 *   - Statistical analysis: avg, min, max, p90, p95, p99 ingredient counts
 * 
 * KEY LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
 * 1. How to create and use Counter metrics for business KPIs
 * 2. How to create and use Trend metrics for statistical analysis
 * 3. How to implement setup() function for pre-test validation
 * 4. How to implement teardown() function for post-test cleanup
 * 5. How custom metrics complement standard K6 performance metrics

/**
 * LOAD TEST CONFIGURATION: Lightweight stages for custom metrics demonstration
 * 
 * Using lighter load (5 VUs vs 20) to focus on metrics collection rather than stress testing.
 * This allows clearer observation of custom metric behavior without overwhelming the system.
 * 
 * Stage Pattern:
 * 1. Ramp-up (5s): 0‚Üí5 VUs - Gradual load increase for metric baseline
 * 2. Steady (10s): 5 VUs - Consistent load for metric trend analysis  
 * 3. Ramp-down (5s): 5‚Üí0 VUs - Clean test completion
 * 
 * MONITORING TIP: Focus on custom metric trends in addition to standard HTTP metrics.
 * Watch how business metrics correlate with technical performance indicators.

/**
 * CUSTOM METRICS DEFINITIONS: Business-specific KPIs for pizza ordering system
 * 
 * K6 provides several metric types for different use cases:
 * - Counter: Cumulative values that only increase (counts, totals)
 * - Trend: Statistical distributions (response times, sizes, quantities)
 * - Gauge: Point-in-time values that can increase/decrease (current state)
 * - Rate: Percentage-based metrics (success rates, ratios)
 */

/**
 * PIZZA COUNTER METRIC: Tracks total successful pizza creations
 * 
 * Type: Counter (cumulative count)
 * Purpose: Business KPI for pizza ordering success rate
 * Usage: pizzas.add(1) for each successful pizza creation
 * 
 * Dashboard Analysis:
 * - Rate: Pizzas created per second (business throughput)
 * - Count: Total pizzas created during test (business volume)
 * - Compare with http_reqs to calculate success ratio
 * 
 * Expected Ratios (as guidance):
 * - Success Rate: quickpizza_number_of_pizzas / http_reqs ‚âà 0.95-1.0 (95-100%)
 * - Business Throughput: Rate depends on test duration (with 1s sleep: ~1 pizza/VU/sec)
 * - Total Volume: ~70-100 pizzas for typical test runs
 * - Pizza/Request Ratio: Should be ~0.98-1.0 for successful requests (each request = 1 pizza)
 * - NOTE: Actual throughput rate varies with total test duration

 * INGREDIENT TREND METRIC: Analyzes pizza complexity distribution
 * 
 * Type: Trend (statistical distribution)
 * Purpose: Business insight into pizza complexity and variety
 * Usage: ingredients.add(count) for each pizza's ingredient count
 * 
 * Dashboard Analysis:
 * - Average: Typical pizza complexity
 * - p95/p99: Most complex pizzas generated
 * - Min/Max: Range of pizza complexity
 * - Distribution: Understanding of pizza variety patterns
 * 
 * Expected Ratios (as guidance):
 * - Average Ingredients: ~5-6 ingredients per pizza (includes base + toppings)
 * - Min Ingredients: ~4-5 (base ingredients + minNumberOfToppings)
 * - Max Ingredients: ~7-8 (base ingredients + maxNumberOfToppings)
 * - p95: ~7 ingredients (complex pizzas with many toppings)
 * - p99: ~8 ingredients (maximum complexity with all constraints)
 * - Distribution: Should show variation between 5-8 ingredients
 * - NOTE: API includes base ingredients beyond configured topping limits
