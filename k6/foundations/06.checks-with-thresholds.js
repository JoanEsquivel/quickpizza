 * K6 FOUNDATIONS: CHECKS WITH THRESHOLDS - BUSINESS LOGIC QUALITY GATES
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * üéØ LEARNING GOAL: Master k6 checks combined with thresholds to create comprehensive
 *    quality gates that validate both performance AND business logic correctness.
 * 
 * üìã WHAT'S NEW IN THIS SCRIPT (vs 05.thresholds.js):
 *    ‚Ä¢ ‚≠ê NEW: Checks threshold - validates business logic success rate
 *    ‚Ä¢ ‚≠ê NEW: Multi-layered quality gates (HTTP + Performance + Business Logic)
 *    ‚Ä¢ ‚≠ê NEW: Functional correctness validation beyond HTTP status codes
 *    ‚Ä¢ Understanding the difference between HTTP success and business success
 *    ‚Ä¢ Creating robust quality gates for CI/CD pipelines
 * 
 * üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è HOW TO RUN THIS TEST:
 *    cd k6/foundations
 *    k6 run 06.checks-with-thresholds.js
 * 
 *    # With QuickPizza running elsewhere:
 *    k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://quickpizza.grafana.com 06.checks-with-thresholds.js
 * 
 *    # With dashboard for real-time monitoring:
 *    K6_WEB_DASHBOARD=true k6 run --linger 06.checks-with-thresholds.js
 * 
 * ‚è±Ô∏è EXPECTED TEST EXECUTION:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Duration: 20 seconds total (5s ramp-up + 10s sustained + 5s ramp-down)
 *    ‚Ä¢ Virtual Users: 5 concurrent users maximum
 *    ‚Ä¢ Load Pattern: Gradual ramp-up to steady state, then graceful shutdown
 *    ‚Ä¢ Total Requests: ~50 HTTP requests (5 VUs √ó 10 seconds √∑ 1s sleep)
 *    ‚Ä¢ Request Rate: ~5 requests/second during sustained phase
 * 
 * üìä KEY METRICS TO MONITOR:
 * 
 *    BUILT-IN METRICS (inherited from previous test):
 *    ‚Ä¢ http_req_failed: < 1% (Infrastructure reliability gate)
 *    ‚Ä¢ http_req_duration p95: < 500ms (User experience gate)
 *    ‚Ä¢ http_req_duration p99: < 1000ms (Worst-case performance gate)
 * 
 *    ‚≠ê NEW METRIC - BUSINESS LOGIC VALIDATION:
 *    ‚Ä¢ checks: > 95% (Business logic correctness gate)
 *      ‚Üí Ensures 95% of all check() assertions pass
 *      ‚Üí Validates functional correctness beyond HTTP success
 *      ‚Üí Catches application bugs that HTTP metrics miss
 * 
 *    CUSTOM METRICS (inherited from previous test):
 *    ‚Ä¢ quickpizza_number_of_pizzas: Counter tracking total pizzas created
 *    ‚Ä¢ quickpizza_ingredients: Average < 8 ingredients per pizza
 * 
 * üéõÔ∏è DASHBOARD ANALYSIS GUIDE:
 * 
 *    OVERVIEW TAB - Multi-Layered Quality Gate Monitoring:
 *    ‚úÖ Green: HTTP Request Failed Rate stays below 1% (Infrastructure OK)
 *    ‚úÖ Green: P95 Response Time stays below 500ms (Performance OK)
 *    ‚úÖ Green: P99 Response Time stays below 1000ms (Worst-case OK)
 *    ‚≠ê NEW: ‚úÖ Green: Check success rate stays above 95% (Business Logic OK)
 *    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Any metric approaching threshold limits
 *    ‚ùå Critical: Any threshold violation = FAILED test
 * 
 *    SUMMARY TAB - ‚≠ê NEW Checks Metric:
 *    Look for: checks.........................: 96.23% ‚úì 187 ‚úó 7
 *    ‚Ä¢ 96.23%: Percentage of successful check assertions
 *    ‚Ä¢ ‚úì 187: Number of passed checks
 *    ‚Ä¢ ‚úó 7: Number of failed checks
 *    ‚Ä¢ Threshold: PASS (96.23% > 95% required)
 * 
 * üîç HTTP SUCCESS vs BUSINESS SUCCESS - Critical Understanding:
 * 
 *    SCENARIO 1 - HTTP Success, Business Failure:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Server returns HTTP 200 ‚úÖ
 *    ‚Ä¢ Response contains invalid pizza data ‚ùå
 *    ‚Ä¢ Without checks threshold: Test PASSES (misleading!)
 *    ‚Ä¢ With checks threshold: Test FAILS (correct!)
 * 
 *    SCENARIO 2 - Both HTTP and Business Success:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Server returns HTTP 200 ‚úÖ
 *    ‚Ä¢ Response contains valid pizza data ‚úÖ
 *    ‚Ä¢ Result: Test PASSES (confident deployment!)
 * 
 *    SCENARIO 3 - HTTP Failure:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Server returns HTTP 500 ‚ùå
 *    ‚Ä¢ No response data to validate ‚ùå
 *    ‚Ä¢ Result: Test FAILS on HTTP threshold (infrastructure issue)
 * 
 * üö® QUALITY GATE LAYERS EXPLAINED:
 * 
 *    LAYER 1 - Infrastructure Reliability:
 *    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'] = 99% HTTP success required
 *    ‚Üí Ensures network, DNS, server availability
 * 
 *    LAYER 2 - Performance Requirements:
 *    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500', 'p(99)<1000']
 *    ‚Üí Ensures acceptable response times for user experience
 * 
 *    ‚≠ê LAYER 3 - Business Logic Correctness (NEW):
 *    checks: ["rate > 0.95"] = 95% check assertions must pass
 *    ‚Üí Ensures application returns correct, valid data
 *    ‚Üí Validates pizza creation logic works properly
 *    ‚Üí Catches data corruption, API contract violations
 * 
 *    LAYER 4 - Application-Specific Metrics:
 *    quickpizza_ingredients: [{ threshold: 'avg<8', abortOnFail: false }]
 *    ‚Üí Ensures business rules are followed (pizza complexity)
 * 
 * üîç WHAT TO WATCH DURING EXECUTION:
 *    1. Console output showing pizza names and ingredient counts
 *    2. ‚≠ê NEW: Check assertions passing/failing in real-time
 *    3. All threshold indicators in dashboard (4 layers of validation)
 *    4. Final test result: PASSED only if ALL layers pass
 *    5. Summary tab showing detailed check statistics
 * 
 * üéØ BUSINESS LOGIC VALIDATION BENEFITS:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Catches application bugs that HTTP metrics miss
 *    ‚Ä¢ Provides confidence in functional correctness
 *    ‚Ä¢ Enables safe automated deployments
 *    ‚Ä¢ Validates API contract compliance
 *    ‚Ä¢ Ensures end-to-end system correctness
 * 
 * üí° PRO TIPS:
 *    ‚Ä¢ 95% check threshold allows for some flakiness (realistic)
 *    ‚Ä¢ 100% check threshold is too strict for production systems
 *    ‚Ä¢ Use descriptive check names for easy debugging
 *    ‚Ä¢ Combine multiple validation layers for comprehensive quality gates
 *    ‚Ä¢ Monitor check failure patterns to identify systemic issues
 * 
 * üìù IMPORTANT NOTE - CHECKS vs THRESHOLDS:
 *    CHECKS = Individual test assertions (what you validate)
 *    Example: check(res, { "status is 200": (res) => res.status === 200 })
 *    
 *    THRESHOLDS = Pass/fail rules on metrics (quality gates for entire test)
 *    Example: checks: ["rate > 0.95"] = 95% of all check assertions must pass
 *    
 *    In this test: You have 1 check per request, so the threshold means
 *    "95% of status code checks must be 200" for the test to PASS.
